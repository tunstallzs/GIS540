In order to run this script you will need to install two python packages.
The First is pillow. This is also called PIL for python image library.  
PIL is responsible for combining and animating GIFs.

The second package is 'glob'. Some python environments already have glob installed.
In this script tool, glob creates lists of files with a similar name, or file type.
